# SaveShard
SaveShard is a tool to create backups of your exitsave for the game Stoneshard. Essentially creating checkpoints for your character.

It's not necessary to modify your game whatsoever. SaveShard *won't modify your game files*, it will only copy data and insert the copied data into the game.
